          <h4 class="question">Is Frontend Mentor free?</h4>
          <div class="iconDiv"></div>
          <p>The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have
            some that are premium and require a Pro subscription to
              access. It will say on each challenge whether they are
              free or premium, so it's easy to tell the difference.

          <p>Definitely! Please do feel free to use whatever you build 
            in your portfolio. Helping developers add professional-looking
            projects to their portfolio was one of the reasons we 
            created this platform!

          <p>The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge
            is in our Discord server. There are thousands of other
              developers in there, so it's a great place to ask 
              questions. We even have a dedicated "help" channel! 
              If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite to 
              our Discord server here.
